Install the application according to your operating system procedure.

### Linux Debian/Raspberry PI

Install the application with:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <downloaded deb file>
```

If it fails to install because dependencies are missing, you can install any required dependencies by running:

```bash
sudo apt install -f
```

And then run the `dpkg` command again to finish the installation.

You can then launch the application by running:

```bash
easy-web-dashboard
```

### MacOS

Download the zip archive for MacOS and extract the contents.

Inside you will find the `easy-web-dashboard.app` application.

It is not a signed and verified application, so you will have to move it out of quarantine to use it:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine easy-web-dashboard.app
```

You can move the application into your 'Applications' folder if you want to make it easy to launch.

The application can be launched from the terminal by running this command pointing to the app:

```bash
open ./easy-web-dashboard.app
```

### Windows

Double click the executable file, this will install the application, you may have to grant permission to allow it to
run.

You should be able to launch the program by searching for `easy-web-dashboard`.

You can also launch the application by running the executable that was installed through the command line.

### Others (Linux Fedora etc.)

page](https://github.com/BusinessSimulations/easy-web-dashboard/releases/tag/0.5.2) to check for a supported installer.
